\begin{frame}[t]{Bayesian Inference How-To}
As the title suggests, this session will be {\bf practical}.
\vspace{1cm}

We will study a selection of techniques that you can use to solve any
inference problem that comes your way!
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]{That said...}
It is inevitable that I will state some opinions and philosophies!\\
{\bf We can't help it.}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]{Python}
Examples will be given in Python, and will use {\tt numpy} for numerical
things (arrays, random number generation), and {\tt matplotlib} for plotting.\\
\vspace{1cm}
Code should work in either Python 2 or 3.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t, fragile]{Python}
All code will assume the following {\tt import} statements.
\begin{minted}[mathescape,
               numbersep=5pt,
               gobble=2,
               frame=lines,
               framesep=2mm]{python}
  import numpy as np
  import numpy.random as rng
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  import copy
\end{minted}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]{Emphasis}
I will try to emphasise the underlying ideas of the methods.\\
I will not
be teaching specific software packages
(e.g. {\it emcee}, {\it MultiNest}, {\it DNest3}), though I may mention them.
